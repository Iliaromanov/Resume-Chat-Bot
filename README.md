# Resume-Chat-Bot
Python AI Chatbot for answering questions related to my resume. <!-- utilizing tensorflow keras DNN and sklearn LinearSVC models as well as nltk and spacy for NLP.-->

*This repo is for the CLI based version of the Chatbot. It shows the development, training, and selection process of the models. The CLI chatbot responses utilize and display the results from each of the existing models as opposed to only using the most accurate model. The web application that only uses the most accurate model can be found at https://github.com/Iliaromanov/Resume-Chatbot-WebApp*
