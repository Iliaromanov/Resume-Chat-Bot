# Resume-Chat-Bot
Python AI Chatbot for answering questions related to my resume. <!-- utilizing tensorflow keras DNN and sklearn LinearSVC models as well as nltk and spacy for NLP.-->

This repo is for the CLI based version of the Chatbot. It shows the development, training, and selection process of the models and NLP pipelines. The CLI chatbot responses utilize and display the results from each of the existing models as opposed to only using the most accurate model. 

The web app repo for this project can be found at https://github.com/Iliaromanov/Resume-Chatbot-WebApp

The repo for the NLP pipeline API I built as a microservice for this project's web app utilizing the NLP pipelines developed in this repository can be found at https://github.com/Iliaromanov/nlp-pipeline-API

## Installation and Setup for CLI Usage

> `pip install -r requirements.txt`

> `git clone https://github.com/Iliaromanov/Resume-Chat-Bot.git`
